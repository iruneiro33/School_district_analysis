# School_district_analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

This challenge analyzed data from an School District including math and reading grades, school funding, school type among other indicators. Howerver, there was evidence of academic dishonesty at the Thomas High School in the reading and math grades for the ninth graders. As such, it is important to replace those values and make adjustments to reflect the performance without the altered data. For this, we replace altered data with NaNs and run the whole analysis to see the effects it might hold within the school performance.
